# BasicCAD_2020-2021

## - Base

### Description
- This assignment was a way to get used to Onshape and the first step to creating a caster. The first part that we made was "The Base".
- The Base is 200mm x 120mm x 8mm with 6 10mm sized holes offset from the edges by 20mm, and another hole 25mm in diameter on the midpoint. (also have the midpoint of the of the document be 60mm from the left edge of the first sketch).
- No fillet edges, no sweeping or lofting, very simple.

### Lesson(s) Learned
- I learned how easy it is to use Onshape.
- I learned that all you really need to recreate a part is to know the dimensions.
- I learned that I am significantly better at CAD than Coding and that I should work to being equally great at both.

## - Mount

### Description
- This assignment was the second step to createing a caster in onshape. This time, I made a Mount for the Caster, to hold everything together.
- The mount is 120mm x 120mm x 8mm with four 10mm sized holes, 20mm away from two sides closest to them, and one 25mm hole in the center. This should be even simpler than the Base.
- No fillets, sweeps, or lofts required.

### Lessen(s) Learned
- I learned that the mount is basically the base but shorter.
- I learned that complex things are just made out of multiple simple things.
- I learned that the Onshape shortcuts make life a lot better.
