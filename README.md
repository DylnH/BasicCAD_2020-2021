# BasicCAD_2020-2021


## - Base

### Description
- This assignment was a way to get used to Onshape and the first step to creating a caster. The first part that we made was "The Base".
- The Base is a rectangular prism 200mm x 120mm x 8mm with 6 10mm sized holes offset from the edges by 20mm, and another hole 25mm in diameter on the midpoint. (also have the midpoint of the of the document be 60mm from the left edge of the first sketch).
- No fillet edges, no sweeping or lofting, very simple.

### Lesson(s) Learned
- I learned how easy it is to use Onshape.
- I learned that all you really need to recreate a part is to know the dimensions.
- I didn't run into any challenges. I feel like my overall knowledge of Cad has helped me with this assignment, and future assignments to come.

## - Mount

### Description
- This assignment was the second step to createing a caster in onshape. This time, I made a Mount for the Caster, to hold everything together.
- The mount is a rectangular prism 120mm x 120mm x 8mm with four 10mm sized holes, 20mm away from two sides closest to them, and one 25mm hole in the center. This should be even simpler than the Base.
- No fillets, sweeps, or lofts required.

### Lessen(s) Learned
- I learned that the mount is basically the base but shorter.
- I learned that the Onshape shortcuts make life a lot better.
- I didn't run into any challenges, however I feel like if I made a copy of the base/Part#1, all I would've neede to do is make a cut and it would've taken 30 sec to do this part.

## - Fork

### Description
- This assignment was the third step to creating a caster.
- The Fork is a 80mm x 8mm cylinder with two filleted 40mm x 5mm x 75mm rectangluar prisms,15mm away from the origin on one side, and the other has a 20mm x 60mm cylinder with a 15mm x 60mm diameter hole.
- there are also two holes that go threw the forks that are 10mm in diameter.

### Lesson(s) Learned
- I learned a few short cuts that you can use to be more efficient.
- I feel like I could've done a few more efficient shetches than what I was told to do, but it still got the jod done
- didn't run into any challenges, but could've done this more efficiently by using certain shortcuts.

## - Tire

### Description
- This assignment was the fourth step to creating a caster.
- The Tire is a trapezoid 10 degrees between its left side and the horizontal centerline, with a 20mm bottom side. it is also 40mm away from the vertical centerline and the top line is 55mm from the vert centerline.
- Then you revolve that sketch and fillet the side by 8mm to make it look like a tire.

### Lesson(s) Learned

- I learned you can see how a part would move, if attached to something in assembly.
- this part went as smoothly as #1 and #2. no problems
- I leanred how to put mulitple parts, assemblies, pictures, and videos in one document.

## - Wheel

### Description
- This assignment was the fifth step to creating a caster. this one is a bit more complex... so here's a picture of the first sketch dowm below. then you revolve it. next you create a "V" shaped sketch on Left that is 60 degrees and centered with Front plane. create two circles on the same sketch. one 60 and one 36, both on the origin. Then extrude cut that sketch and use a Featured cicular pattern 6 times. then cut a 10mm hole through the center.
- do some fillets and chamfers to your liking and your done. there are also two bearing types you'll need to make. one 20mm in diameter with a 10mm hole, and the other 30mm and 20mm. both extruded by 5mm.

Sketch Here!!!

### Lesson(s) Learned
- I learned how to use circular patterns on Onshape.
- The circular pattern feature on Onshape is very simular to Solidworks so it was ver simple to use.

## - Axle and collar

### Description
- This assignment was the sixth step to creating a caster. for the caster, you need to make a 10mm cirlce and a 6mm cirlce on the origon and then extrude it 60mm.then cut out a two notch at the edges by sketching a line 4.5mm away from the origon. axle complete. now with the collar, make a 15mm cirle and a 10mm cirlce on the edge of part 1. cut out of 3mm hole through part. two.

(big bearing. info in wheel)

### Lesson(s) Learned
- I learned that you can make new ducument just by extruding and instead of selecting "Add" selected "New" instead.
- didn't run into many cahallenges. just needed to work out more complex sketching mechanics.

## - Caster

### Description
- This assignment was the final step to creating a caster. I'm not going to lie, while doing this assignment, I wasn't the best with Onshape's mate system, but I got in to work. It's basically a much of cylindrical mates because there are alot of holes. but if you get past that your golden

### Lesson(s) Learned
- I learned how the basics on assemblies
- I learned the basics on mates
- ran into some challenges working out a new mating system. if I went back to it, there would be way less mates and things would line up better. I was dealing with not knowing which mates to use but got it to work decently.

## - Challenge

### Description
- This assignment was a challenge to test your Cad Skillz. first, to make a cude with four cylinders sticking out the side, then you and a fork, simular to the caster, and a brace to hold them all together. the mates you use should make the everything spin.

### Lesson(s) Learned
- ran into a minor challenge with mates, but I figured it out.
- using a screen recorder is fun...

## - Group collab

### Description
- This assignment was a group team build thingawabob that we did in one class period. Bob and Alden did two parts each and I did two aswell. I made the pump and rod. I first imported an image if the pump that was already given and traced it in a sketch. then I made a a cylinder, cut a hole in it and mated my parts to theirs.

didn't make the document so heres a video.

### Lesson(s) Learned
- things go quick when 3 CAD wizzez are at work.
- I now know and feel confortable with Onshapes mating system.
- the only real challenge was just working together but it didn't effect use that much.
