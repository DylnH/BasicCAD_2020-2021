# BasicCAD_2020-2021
Basic_CAD assignment for 2020-2021 school year.

## - Base

### Description
- This assignment was a way to get used to Onshape and the first step to creating a caster. The first part that we made was "The Base".
- The Base is 200mm x 120mm x 8mm with 6 10mm sized holes offset from the edges by 20mm, and another hole 25mm in diameter on the midpoint. (also have the midpoint of the of the document be 60mm from the left edge of the first sketch).
- No fillet edges, no sweeping or lofting, very simple.

### Lesson(s) Learned
- I learned how easy it is to use Onshape
- I learned that all you really need to recreate a part is to know the dimensions.
- I learned that I am significantly better at CAD than Coding and that I should work to being equally great at both.
