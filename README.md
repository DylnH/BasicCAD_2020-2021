# BasicCAD_2020-2021

## - Base

### Description
- This assignment was a way to get used to Onshape and the first step to creating a caster. The first part that we made was "The Base".
- The Base is a rectangular prism 200mm x 120mm x 8mm with 6 10mm sized holes offset from the edges by 20mm, and another hole 25mm in diameter on the midpoint. (also have the midpoint of the of the document be 60mm from the left edge of the first sketch).
- No fillet edges, no sweeping or lofting, very simple.

### Lesson(s) Learned
- I learned how easy it is to use Onshape.
- I learned that all you really need to recreate a part is to know the dimensions.
- I learned that I am significantly better at CAD than Coding and that I should work to being equally great at both.

## - Mount

### Description
- This assignment was the second step to createing a caster in onshape. This time, I made a Mount for the Caster, to hold everything together.
- The mount is a rectangular prism 120mm x 120mm x 8mm with four 10mm sized holes, 20mm away from two sides closest to them, and one 25mm hole in the center. This should be even simpler than the Base.
- No fillets, sweeps, or lofts required.

### Lessen(s) Learned
- I learned that the mount is basically the base but shorter.
- I learned that complex things are just made out of multiple simple things.
- I learned that the Onshape shortcuts make life a lot better.

## - Fork

### Description
- This assignment was the third step to creating a caster.
- The Fork is a 80mm x 8mm cylinder with two filleted 40mm x 5mm x 75mm rectangluar prisms,15mm away from the origin on one side, and the other has a 20mm x 60mm cylinder with a 15mm x 60mm diameter hole.
- there are also two holes that go threw the forks that are 10mm in diameter.

### Lesson(s) Learned
- I learned a few short cuts that you can use to be more efficient.
- I learned that the appearence panel is still against colorblind people.
- I learned that butterflies taste with their feet while designing this.

## - Tire

### Description
- This assignment was the fourth step to creating a caster.
- The Tire is a trapezoid 10 degrees between its left side and the horizontal centerline, with a 20mm bottom side. it is also 40mm away from the vertical centerline and the top line is 55mm from the vert centerline.
- Then you revolve that sketch and fillet the side by 8mm to make it look like a tire.

### Lesson(s) Learned
- I learned that I can get a part done in under a minute.
- I learned that there are many ways to do the same thing.
- I learned you can see how a part would move, if attached to something in assembly.

## - Wheel

### Description
- This assignment was the fifth step to creating a caster. this one is a bit more complex... so here's a picture of the first sketch dowm below. then you revolve it. next you create a "V" shaped sketch on Left that is 60 degrees and centered with Front plane. create two circles on the same sketch. one 60 and one 36, both on the origin. Then extrude cut that sketch and use a Featured cicular pattern 6 times. then cut a 10mm hole through the center.
- do some fillets and chamfers to your liking and your done. there are also two bearing types you'll need to make. one 20mm in diameter with a 10mm hole, and the other 30mm and 20mm. both extruded by 5mm.

Sketch Here!!!

### Lesson(s) Learned
- I learned how to use circular patterns on Onshape.
- I learned that that wheels are pretty basic.
- I learned that the split feature will scare you if you just trying to fillet something and the hole part just "splits" in half.

## - Axle and collar

### Description
- This assignment was the sixth step to creating a caster. for the caster, you need to make a 10mm cirlce and a 6mm cirlce on the origon and then extrude it 60mm.then cut out a two notch at the edges by sketching a line 4.5mm away from the origon. axle complete. now with the collar, make a 15mm cirle and a 10mm cirlce on the edge of part 1. cut out of 3mm hole through part. two.
